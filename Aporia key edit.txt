Hi guys!
We understand that left-handed people and people using different keyboards would like to rebind the controls, and it's on our to-do list. 
But if you can't wait... 

While we cannot support it officially, we're ok with providing the controls-file unencrypted for you to edit. It's called "defaultprofile.xml" and can be downloaded in it's unencrypted state for Aporia v1.1.0 here:
http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=66250600801569675967

The file is only meant for developers and is not formatted to be user friendly. Additionally I should add that basic controller movement and camera (look) controls are not exposed in this file.

Once you've made your desired edits, it needs to replace the "defaultconfig.xml" inside AporiaData/GameData.pak/Libs/Config (navigate the .pak file and drag&drop the new .xml through winrar or 7zip). 

Again, this is not supported officially, and we'll most likely not have time or resources to help you setup the controls, or repair your install should you render the game unplayable. 
Make edits at your own risk!

Happy Editting!
