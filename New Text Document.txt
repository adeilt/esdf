Controls for left handed

For those who are not very technical, I've uploaded a new file with arrow keys, right control, and right shift enabled.

For many years, I've used 7zip which is a free and small download from http://www.7-zip.org

Install that

Download the new control xml: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KhgnneyjK3h0fLjTnzJl5gsHtI1aPu7E

Browse to the Aporia game directory

Then enter AporiaData sub-dir

Right click on the file "GameData.pak" and use 7zip menu item to open the archive

Open "Libs" directory then from there open "Config" directory

Drag and drop the new xml file downloaded above into the archive at this location. It should re-save the archive with the new file.

You can then close the archive and start Aporia



If you don't trust my file, you can download the one the Aporia devs have available. Edit it, find the player control items under <actionmap name="player"> and use these values (or any values you want provided they are correct):
up, down, left, right, rctrl, rshift

I've provided this for anyone less technical and who wishes to have less breakage possibility over the dev provided version and warning or even just wants more info of the process involved or yet still those who just want to skip some of it.

Have fun!
