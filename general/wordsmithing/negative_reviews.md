# Negative review templates for unrebindable keyboard controls

I'm attempting here to let game devs know that I'm not satisfied with the lack
of keyboard rebinding in games I buy.  I'm hoping to develop reviews that:

- convey that message,
- communicate conditions under which I would revisit my review,
- offer a variety of reasons why players want keyboard rebinding supported,
- anticipate the usual suggestions that helpful people offer and cover why they
  don't work well for me.

The first section below is Review Templates that can be pasted into Steam's
review field and adjusted as needed.  The Addenda section contains paragraphs
that can be added depending on circumstance.

## Review Templates

### Partial controller support

I don't recommend the game at this time because the keyboard controls cannot be
rebound.

This game has only partial controller support and no rebinding of keyboard
controls.  I expect fully released PC games (i.e. not early access) to have at
least one or the other for lots of reasons (e.g. accessibility, AZERTY keyboard
users, personal preferences/comfort).

Partial controller support is good, but not everyone has or can use a
controller.  I've tried AutoHotKey, reWASD, and similar solutions, but they all
have drawbacks.

I look forward to revisiting the game and this review when keyboard control
rebinding is fully supported.

### Refunding

Refunding, but I'd consider repurchasing if full keyboard rebinding were
implemented.
